# GameShow

Plugin for a Game Show, allows multiple players to partake in challenges to find a word.  
The host decides whether a player has won a challenge or not.

When a player wins a challenge, they receive a random letter of the word they need to complete, players can guess what the word is, but if they do and it's wrong, they lose the game.
